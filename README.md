# Domestic AI

Domestic AI is a local artificial intelligence environment crafted with üíõ by oio. It runs on your computer and can be accessible from anywhere.

## Philosophy

Domestic AI is a decentralised system made of small pieces of software cooperating together. It's modular and sustainable, and everybody can run it on their machine and customise it. AI is becoming a fundamental technology in many fields: we believe it should become accessible to everybody, and we want individuals to be able to build and own their own models. It's important for people to have control on the technologies they're using, not only to protect their data but also because learning how these tools work is empowering. For this reason we started to think about the concept of Domestic AI and this is the first step to make it real. We're creating an open-source project containing instructions for the usage and contribution. We hope it will be useful to anybody wishing to experiment with AI without maybe having access to the commercial models.

## What's Domestic AI made of

Domestic AI is a system of multiple independent apps running on your computer. The system is built in a semi-decentralised way so that if a piece breaks all the others aren't affected. You can call each service individually or use the Discord bot Roby or the Rest API interface, which can call all the others. Many apps generally rely on Ollama models, so you need to install it and have it running before being able to fully use the tools. By creating a tunnel from your domain to the apps, you can run your local AI from anywhere.

## Running Domestic AI

### Setup

The setup is done by the startup script. Run it and you'll be ready to go.

```
cd PATH_TO_startup.sh
chmod +x startup.sh
./startup.sh
```

### Running the services

Use `./startup.sh` to start the services.
When the script is running, you can access the API at `http://0.0.0.0:35672`.

## How to work with this repo

The Domestic AI repository is a container of submodules. This means it collects and references to independent repositories. You can add new submodules and update existing ones. For new submodules it's recommended to create a new repo separately, and later add it to this as a submodule.

### Add a new submodule

> The standard case for adding a new submodule is adding a new tool for the Domestic AI universe. This must be done from the [Domestic Tools repo](https://github.com/oio/domestic-tools). Go there and follow the instructions.

Usually you don't need to add a submodule directly inside this root repository. Instead, you can add it to the [Domestic Tools repo](https://github.com/oio/domestic-tools). You might want to do it if you want to implement a new system to interact with the API (e.g. a Telegram bot). For new tools and stuff accessible from the API, you can just add it to the [Domestic Tools repo](https://github.com/oio/domestic-tools).
Here are the steps to follow to add a new submodule:

1. Create a new repository
1. Document it
1. Push your code to it
1. Move to this repo via `cd [PATH_TO_YOUR_oio-domestic-ai]`
1. `git submodule add [GITHUB_LINK_OF_THE_REPO_YOU_JUST_CREATED]`
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m 'added new submodule with name [NAME_OF_THE_SUBMODULE]'`
1. `git push`
1. You might also need to recursively update in order to copy the submodule's content: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

See [the submodules documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more information.

### Update existing submodules or pool new tools

1. You can directly edit your changes from the submodule's folder inside the domestic-ai main repo
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m '[YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE]'`
1. `git push -u origin HEAD:main`
   After you pushed in the submodule's repo, you can just move to the domestic-ai main repo
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m 'edited submodule with name [NAME_OF_THE_SUBMODULE]'`
1. `git push`
